# FuzzyData

### Frontend changes

On the platform-client project in Ushahidi, we added a new view called Wordstat. This view can be accessed via the front page (Home). When the Wordstat view is selected, it is possible to see word frequency for (relevant) words. The idea is that you can get the current pulse of what is happening in incoming posts. The word frequency is calculated by using natural language processing. For now the data is hardcoded into the platform-client project. The hardcoded data was achieved through the python nltp library.

### TODO for the future

For the future, one possibility is to make the words more interactive in order to see related words to for example "need", which are better explained in a context. Another thing to fix is of course to not hard code the data.
